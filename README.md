# Build your own copilot

...

## Common use-cases for LLMs:
1. Summarisaton
1. Writing aid
1. Image generation
1. Code generation or transformation
1. Chat and conversation
1. Question-answering
1. Reason over structured or unstructured data
1. Search

## Prompt Engineering Guidelines
1. Give clearer instructions
1. Split complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks
1. Structure the instructions to keep the model on task
1. Prompt the model to explain before answering
1. Aks for justifications of many possible answer, and then synthesize
1. Generate may outputs and then use the mdoel to pick the best one.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques
1. Role prompting or Personas
1. Prompt Chaining
1. Prompt Chunking
1. Zero, One, or Few Shot Reasoning
1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
1. Selection-inference

## Other Conecepts
1. Fine Tuning
1. Hallucination
1. Retrieval Augmented Generation
