# Professional Financial Services Example

The professional services industry is a highly educated workforce with 
relatively low levels of productivity. This makes the industry a prime 
candidate for GAI transformation. As GAI automates routine and well defined tasks, the highly skilled workforce can spend more time on 
higher value thinking. With GAI, Australia could build on its reputation 
for high calibre knowledge workers, particularly in financial and legal 
sectors.
